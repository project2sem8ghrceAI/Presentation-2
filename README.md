## Malware detection System using Deep Learning 



The malware industry continues to be a well-organized, well-funded market dedicated to evading traditional security measures. Once a computer is infected by malware, criminals can hurt consumers and enterprises in many ways. Malware is one of the most serious security threats on the Internet today. In fact, most Internet problems such as spam e-mails and denial of service attacks have malware as their underlying cause. That is, computers that are compromised with malware are often networked together to form botnets, and many attacks are launched using these malicious, attacker-controlled networks. 

Malware is a persistent and growing threat, and traditional security measures can struggle to keep pace with the ever-evolving techniques used by malware authors. Fortunately, machine learning and deep learning has shown promise as a means of detecting and preventing malware infections.

One of the key advantages of machine-based approaches is that they can adapt to new and previously unseen malware threats, whereas traditional signature-based approaches can only detect known malware variants. Models can be trained on large datasets of both benign and malicious software to learn the characteristics that distinguish malware from legitimate software, allowing them to identify new, unknown malware based on these learned patterns.

Deep learning models are particularly well-suited for identifying patterns and features in complex, high-dimensional data, such as the raw binary code of software applications, which can be a challenging task for traditional machine learning algorithms. These networks learn to extract relevant features from the binary code, such as opcode sequences and control flow graphs, that can be used to distinguish between malicious and legitimate software. Once trained, these models can be used to classify new, previously unseen software as either malware or benign.
